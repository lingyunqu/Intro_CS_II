## The primitive built-in types
remember: type: a set of possible values and a set of operations for an object

char: 26 alphabetic characters, 0-9

integer: (1) decimal (starting with 0b, base-2 number) (2) binary  (3) octal (starting with 0, base-8 number) (4) hexadecimal (starting with 0x, base-16 number)

integer suffix: U for unsigned literals, L for long literals, F for floating literals

## Initialization and assignment
Initialization:
```cpp
int a=5;
```
determine the initial value that the variable is to start with

When no initializer is specified: 
```cpp
int a;
a=5;
```
